DECENTRALIZED ORACLE NETWORK
DECENTRALIZED DATA SOURCE

centralized oracle network: our javascript API
centralized data source: binance api on cryptoprices

Chainlink, which is a decentralized oracle network, feeds data to a contract on the blockchain. 
Then we are accessing this data by reading from this smart contract.
Chainlink uses a "off-chain" mechanism to provide data to the smart contract. The data gathering
is using a consensus mechanism.
