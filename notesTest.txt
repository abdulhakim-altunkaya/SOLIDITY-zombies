The contract() function
Behind the scenes, Truffle adds a thin wrapper around Mocha in order to make testing simpler. 

group tests by calling a function named contract(). It extends Mocha's describe() by providing a list 
of accounts for testing and doing some cleanup as well.

contract() takes two arguments. The first one, a string, must indicate what we’re going to test. 
The second parameter, a callback, is where we’re going to actually write our tests.

execute them: the way we’ll be doing this is by calling a function named it() which also takes 
two arguments: a string that describes what the test actually does and a callback.

Putting it together, here's a bare-bones test:

 contract("MyAwesomeContract", (accounts) => {
   it("should be able to receive Ethers", () => {
   })
 })
