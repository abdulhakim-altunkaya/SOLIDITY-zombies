★ pragma version means solidity compiler version 

★ state variables are stored on the contract storage. Which means they are written to Ethereum blockchain. 

★ uint = uint256 (256 bit unsigned integer)
2 ** 5 means 2 to the power of 5 which means 2*2*2*2*2

structs allow us to create more complex data types that can have multiple properties.
Creating a struct array is useful, it will act like a database on the blockchain. 

strings : arbitrary-length UTF-8 data.

★ Function parameter variable names start with "_" as a convention. 
private function names also start with "_" as a convention. 


★ pure functions do not read and change any data on the blockchain. 
view functions read data from the blockchain but do not change it. 

★ keccak256 hashing function converts the input to a random 256 bit hexadecimal number. It expects
a "bytes" data type input. For this reason we need to encode other data types.
keccak256 can be used for cryptography and also for (almost)random number generation.
